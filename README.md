# Coding Challenge


```
git clone --recursive git@gitlab.com:AsterYujano/coding-challenge.git
```

> Note the `recursive` flag which means to clone submodules as well inside the project.
> 
> This project is divided in 3 micro-services. 2 nodejs applications & 1 database. The 2 applications have their own repository, they are included into that project thanks to git submodules.
